- When force hiding the HUD upon opening the pause menu, the timers for hiding the HUD DO NOT reset and will continue to count down.
  Attempting to call a HUD update while this happens will update HUD values but WILL NOT make the HUD visible. 
  If multiple HUD updates are called in a chain while this happens, the HUD will be noticiably missing from the game for an extended period of time.
  (I beleive the timers stack while the HUD is in this state for some reason, but I may be wrong about that)

- If a HUD update is called and another is called while the timer for hiding the HUD for the first call is = 0 but the HUD 
  fade out animation is still playing, then the timer of the second HUD will run at x2 speed. This doesnt cause any noticible issues.
