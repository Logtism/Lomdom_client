Hey!

Thanks for downloading my music. Let's get straight to the boring, but IMPORTANT part. 

This download is ROYALTY-FREE. 
You are permitted to use it across all creative industries (Films, Games, TV, Online Videos, Radio, Podcast, Audiobook etc)

WHAT YOU CANNOT DO.

You aren't allowed to remix, upload or redistribute my audio files as your own.

Examples of this would be - 
- Uploading my audio onto Soundcloud, Spotify etc
- Uploading my audio onto your youtube for others to download and use for themselves.

If you use my audio in a project which condones hate or promotes violence toward an individual, organisation or religion, I reserve the right to issue an automatic removal of my audio.

By using my audio, you consent to the above rules. 
Any questions? Get in touch.
